Official Tutla Assistant Bot source code

## The Bot
The Tutla Assitant bot has been a project I've worked on for a long time. Today, I decided to share this project.
Tutla Assistant is a Discord Selfbot that has many QOL & Helpful commands, you can see all the commands by running `.help` on any channel.

## Note
This is a selfbot and break Discord's TOS, use it knowing the risks. Secondly, the source code provided is raw and has not been modified for your installation. You willl manually have to change the invite links and so on, you may want to change:
- The Admin Command Roles
- Invite
- Support Links
- Custom Discord server configurations
- Ballsdex pings for myself

## Installation
You require:
- Python 3.8+

  Python Libraries:
- discord.py-self
- wikipedia
- freegpt
- BeautifulSoup
- pillow

**YOU DO NOT NEED DISCORD INSTALLED, IT USES DISCORD's API TO SEND AND GET REQUESTS**

To install this you will first install Python 3.8+ with it in the environment variables. After that you may want to install each of the libraries as follows:
`pip install discord.py-self wikipedia freegpt beautifulsoup4 pillow`

Once successfully installing the libraries you would want to make some changes in the file as it has many advertisements to our Discord and more which have been listed in the notice above.
